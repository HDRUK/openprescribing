Black triangle drugs as classified by the EMA are treatments that present higher risks, and are therefore under additional monitoring by regulatory authorities. It is - absolutely - not bad to prescribe black triangle drugs. However, these drugs generally have less long-term safety data. The “black triangle” classification means, therefore, that patients are to be monitored more closely. <a href='/black_triangle/'>Read more</a>"],
