    "Ghost-branded generics are items when the prescription incorrectly includes a manufacturer name, leading to unecessary excess cost.   <a href='https://ebmdatalab.net/ghost-branded-generics-a-new-dashboard-on-openprescribing/'>Read more on our blog</a>."

  "why_it_matters": [
    "When an item is prescribed generically, the dispenser is reimbursed at the price in the Drug Tariff; but when a manufacturer is stated, the reimbursement price is usually more expensive. A list of products which have been prescribed as ghost-generics is available on every CCG and Practice dashboard page. "
