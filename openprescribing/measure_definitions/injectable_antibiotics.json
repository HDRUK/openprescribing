    "<p>Antimicrobial resistance poses a significant threat to public health, especially because antimicrobials underpin routine medical practice.",
    "It is important that we don't overuse antibiotics.",
    "This measure shows the use of injectable preparations that are listed in chapter 5 - Infections of the British National Formulary.",
    "We have excluded <a href='https://openprescribing.net/dmd/vmp/324311004/'>colistimethate sodium</a> as the injection is more commonly inhaled for the treatment of infections in people with cystic fibrosis.</p>",
    "<p>The prescribing of injectable antibiotics may vary substantially throughout the country depending on the availability of local services such as Antibiotic Outpatient Parenteral Therapy (OPAT) services, where patients receive injectable antibiotics in their own home.",
    "Nevertheless it is important to audit and review the appropriateness of all treatments to support good antimicrobial stewardship.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Please note that this is an experimental measure. We would be grateful for any feedback at <a href='mailto:feedback@openprescribing.net?Subject=Injectable%20Antibiotics%20Measure'>feedback@openprescribing</a></strong>.</p>"
