The files in 1/ contain data about two VMPs, and their associated VMPPs, AMPs,
and AMPPs.

The VMPs are:

 * Diclofenac 2.32% gel (22480211000001104)
    * This is used to test that all associated objects get created correctly
    * There are three VMPPs:
        * Diclofenac 2.32% gel 30 gram
        * Diclofenac 2.32% gel 50 gram
        * Diclofenac 2.32% gel 100 gram
    * There are three AMPs:
        * Diclofenac 2.32% gel (Colorama Pharmaceuticals Ltd)
        * Diclofenac 2.32% gel (DE Pharmaceuticals)
        * Voltarol 12 Hour Emulgel P 2.32% gel (GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare)
    * There are seven AMPPs:
        * Only Voltarol is available in a 100 gram pack
    * The family has two BNF codes:
        * 1003020U0AAAIAI is the code for the VMP and all VMPPs
        * 1003020U0BBADAI is the code for the Voltarol AMP and its AMPPs
        * The generic AMPs and AMPPs are not given BNF codes in the mapping
        * See ../bnf_code_mapping/README.txt for details of the mapping
 * Adenosine 6mg/2ml solution for injection vials (35894711000001106)
    * This is used to test that the VMP's BNF code is set correctly
    * The VMP has no BNF code, but both its VMPPs have the same BNF code (0203020C0AAAAAA)

The files in 2/ contain identical data, except that the VPID of the first VMP
has been changed from 22480211000001104 to 12345.  Additionally, this VMP now
has a VPIDPREV field, and all references to the old VPID have been updated
