<h2>About</h2>

<p>This site aims to make NHS prescribing data clear, open and accessible. You can use it to explore patterns of prescribing nationally, in CCGs, and in individual GP practices. The coding lead is Anna Powell-Smith, the academic lead is Dr. Ben Goldacre, from the <a href="http://www.cebm.net/">Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine</a> in the Department of Primary Care at the University of Oxford.</p>

<p>OpenPrescribing is one of a range of projects built by the EBMdataLab to help make complex medical and scientific data more accessible and more impactful in the real world. Phase 1 of this project was funded by the <a href="http://weahsn.net">West of England Academic Health Science Network</a>, led by Dr. Peter Brindle. This site is currently in pre-release beta. There is much more to come, get in touch to find out more.</p>

<p>We accept no liability for any errors in the data: use this data at your own risk. You should not use this data to make individual prescribing decisions. This prescribing data requires careful interpretation, and the information should not be looked at in isolation, as discussed elsewhere on the site.</p>
