  There appear to be outliers (relating to <span class="outliers"></span>) in this analysis. These may not be interesting if they are caused by an unusually small list size or a very low prescribing volume. Such outliers can make the rest of the chart difficult to read.  <a href="#" class="toggle"></a>
