<h2>Caution: how to use the data responsibly</h2>

<p>Prescribing data requires careful interpretation. Here's how to use it responsibly.</p>

<h3>Understanding the data</h3>

<p>We strongly recommend reading the HSCIC's <a href="http://www.hscic.gov.uk/gpprescribingdata">introduction to prescribing data</a>, including their excellent <a href="http://www.hscic.gov.uk/media/10048/FAQs-Practice-Level-Prescribingpdf/pdf/PLP_FAQs_April_2015.pdf">FAQ</a> (PDF) and <a href="http://www.hscic.gov.uk/media/10686/Download-glossary-of-terms-for-GP-prescribing---presentation-level/pdf/PLP_Presentation_Level_Glossary_April_2015.pdf">glossary of terms</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>Just because a practice or CCG is an outlier for high or low use of a particular treatment, that doesn't necessarily mean they are good or bad prescribers. These are <em>measures</em> rather than <em>indicators</em>, and they need to be interpreted judiciously.</p>

<p>For example, a practice that prescribes a lot of benzodiazepines may have a lower threshold for prescribing them, or may run a specialist service for people with substance misuse, or have one doctor with an interest in - and long list of - such patients.</p>

<h3>Using the right denominators</h3>

<p>We use this site a lot for our own work and our own research. When we use the <a href="{% url 'analyse' %}">analysis page</a>, we find it useful to choose denominators cautiously.</p>

<p>You can use "list size" which tells you how many patients a practice covers, but this can be problematic, because different practices will have different kinds of patients, some with lots of older people, and so on.</p>

<p>To account for this the NHS uses imperfect but useful "adjusted" denominators called STAR-PUs, which try to account for the age and sex structure of the practice's population. These STAR-PUs are specific to specific disease areas, because they try to account for different rates of usage -- in different age bands of the population - for specific treatment. So for the STAR-PU for cardiovascular disease prevention prescribing, for example, gives you extra points for every man aged 40-50, even more for men aged 50-60, and so on; but less for women in the same bands, and very little for younger people.</p>

<p>Generating these STAR-PUs for each practice, each disease area, and each month, takes coder time, so we currently only have the STAR-PU for antibiotics. We would like to add STAR-PUs for all disease areas. If you have generated that data already, or are able to fund us to do it, this is very straightforward, please <a href="mailto:mail@openprescribing.net">get in touch</a>.</p>

<p>When using the data ourselves we tend to use more thoughtful approaches to try to "bake in" population prevalence or need for a particular condition, or to explore different prescribing patterns. For example, we often use whole classes of drug as the denominator in our analyses, as in the video walkthroughs; or we compare the use of one drug against the use of another. When looking at whether a practice is using a lot of Nexium (an expensive "proton pump inhibitor" pill for treating ulcers) we might look at "Nexium prescribing" versus "all proton pump inhibitor prescribing" (<a href="{% url 'analyse' %}#org=CCG&numIds=0103050E0BB&denomIds=1.3.5">example</a>).</p>

<p>Play around and <a href="mailto:mail@openprescribing.net">let us know</a> if you find anything interesting, or develop any interesting methods.</p>

<h3>Our prescribing metrics</h3>

<p>There are currently six standard prescribing measures on the dashboard pages for <a href="{% url 'all_ccgs' %}">CCGs</a> and <a href="{% url 'all_practices' %}">practices</a>, to get you going. These were developed in discussion between Jeff Aronson, Kamal Mahtani, and Ben Goldacre at the University of Oxford and are indicative of what the site can do.</p>

<p>We would like to run workshops to develop 100 standard measures (creating a long list of candidates, choosing the best, and implementing the code). If you are able to fund this, please <a href="mailto:mail@openprescribing.net">get in touch</a>.</p>

<h3>Our disclaimer</h3>

<p>We accept no liability for any errors in the data or its publication here: use this data at your own risk. You should not use this data to make individual prescribing decisions.</p>
